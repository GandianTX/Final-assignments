            Working in vivid washes of ink and oil paint, artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maxnaylorart/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">Max Naylor</a> renders impressionistic dreamscapes that emerge from nostalgic recollections and imagined spaces. Focusing on natural textures like gilled mushrooms scaling a tree trunk  or the soft ripples of water, Naylor creates what he calls a “parallel universe, a microcosm that is similar to our world but free from the shackles of reality.” The scenes often veer toward the unnatural, favoring otherworldly color palettes and unlikely lighting. “In these spaces, it can be night and day simultaneously,” he says. “You can stare up at the sky whilst noticing the plants flowering at your feet.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The ethereal qualities of Naylor's works echo his process, which involves letting the fluid materials dictate the contours of the compositions and allowing the landscapes to “well up from my subconscious and spill onto the surface…The works in ink are made quickly. At the same time, I'm working on larger oil paintings that take much longer. Working at these different tempos keeps things fresh and exciting for me, with the works in ink continually informing the works in oil.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Based in Bristol, Naylor has a studio at <a href="https://www.spikeisland.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">Spike Island</a> and currently teaches at London's <a href="https://www.royaldrawingschool.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red"> Royal Drawing School</a> . You can find more of his landscapes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maxnaylorart/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">Instagram</a>.

            In vivid pinks, reds, greens, and blues, Oakland-based artist <a href="https://www.malisasuchanya.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">Malisa Suchanya</a> renders the expressive contours of hands immersed in florals and ornamental motifs. Interested in painting the human figure, she started to focus on the appendages specifically during the pandemic, sharing that she “
              <span class="span-color">
              found a deep love and satisfaction in trying to convey emotion and reflect relationships all through the different arrangements, compositions, and entanglement.” She then participated in <a href="https://www.vargallery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-stringify-link="https://www.vargallery.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" class="hover-red">Var Gallery</a>'s ongoing <i data-stringify-type="italic">30 x 30 x 30</i> project, which invites artists to make 30 artworks in 30 days every January, spurring creativity at the start of the new year.

          </p>
          <p>
              <span class="span-color">
            “I know very well that it's projects like these that harbor an amazing environment for growth, and that was exactly what it was for me,” Suchanya says. Required to complete a painting per day, she spent about five hours on each work, plus an hour or two to prepare the next one. “Over the course of the month, I did find that my technique of painting changed quite a bit. It became a bit more time efficient and I was layering my colors with more confidence and ease… and it became close to meditative.”
              </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Suchanya organized three sub-series within the collection, including 
            <span class="span-color">
              portraits of hands belonging people who have have deeply impacted her throughout her life, reflections on being with others, and 
            </span>
            her cultural identity and upbringing in Singapore. Hands blossom from floral arrangements in the portraits series and are titled with individuals' names, while limbs that twist and float on a black background comprise a set exploring the nuances of relationships. And looking to her
            <span class="span-color">
            Chinese, Indonesian, and Thai heritage, she included examples of colorful, traditional masks framed by hands. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the year, Suchanya participates in markets and artist fairs around the country, including <a href="https://www.sanjosemade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">San Jose Made</a>, which you can find updates about on her<a href="https://www.malisasuchanya.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">website</a>  and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/malisasuchanya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">Instagram</a>. She will also have a solo exhibition at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mompopart" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">Mom and Pop Art Shop</a> in Point Richmond, California, later this year, and <em>30 x 30 x 30 </em>continues at Var Gallery in Milwaukee through June 4.

          In the 7th or 8th century, Chinese artisans devised a way to combine feldspar and kaolin and fire it at a very high temperature to produce the first porcelain, which was traded globally and highly sought-after for its elegant surfaces and ornate designs. The precise process wasn't easy to replicate: not until the early 18th century did makers in Germany first achieve the right mix of materials and methods to produce the ceramic in Europe. Around the world, the bright, white surfaces of dinnerware and decorative vessels provided canvases for the painstaking craft of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_painting" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">porcelain painting</a>, emphasizing numerous patterned layers of colorful glaze. For Ukrainian artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tiletiletesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover-red">Julia Pilipchatina</a> , the craft of hand-embellishing plates connects her to a rich creative legacy and to personal stories and family heirlooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formally educated as a historian, Pilipchatina is fascinated by the profound ties to ancestry and culture that tableware represents.
          <span class="span-color">
            “By choosing a unique plate for ourselves, we draw upon our own values, and—I hope—these objects remain in our families as testament to the lives of past generations,” she says.
          </span>  
          As a refugee from Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, the artist was forced to close her workshop, leave all of her belongings behind—save for her two dogs—and start from scratch. Now in Belgium, she's developing a series of plates depicting detailed, chromatic insects with spotted wings, serrated legs, and feathery feet. She says:

              The <em>Beetles</em> series was born out of an attempt to overcome my fear. It's difficult for me to approach the topic of war. It's too painful and feels like a black hole that drags me in as soon as I focus on it. But I suppose the nature of fear is the same, and I decided to take on a somewhat safe but strong and irrational fear of insects.
            </span>

        </p>
        <p>
          While insects have long appeared in ceramic tableware alongside other popular motifs like birds, trees, and bucolic landscapes, Pilipchatina renders each critter in a style mirroring her watercolor<a class="c-link hover-red" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/168091849/Bugs-watercolor" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-stringify-link="https://www.behance.net/gallery/168091849/Bugs-watercolor" data-sk="tooltip_parent" class="hover-red">illustrations</a> , inspired by an encyclopedia depicting exotic, jewel-colored specimens in intricate detail. The more she studied the images, the more the creatures ceased to be a source of anxiety as she noted their elaborate patterns and found beauty in their vibrance and textures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each bug's bold, saturated color emerges through the meticulous layering of thin coats of paint, or overglaze, to the surface, then firing the piece at 800 degrees Celsius. 
          <span class="span-color">
            “The cycle consists of heating and cooling to room temperature, which means that one firing can last 12 hours,” Pilipchatina says. “Since the paint is semi-transparent, achieving brightness, depth, and contrast requires many layers, and therefore many firings.”
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="span-color">
            Emphasizing beauty as a reprieve from the loss of her home and the ugliness of war, the artist focuses on tenderness and fragility in the natural world and humanity's relationship with it and one another. Combining art and utility, an elegantly crafted dish emphasizes longevity, continuity, and tradition while connecting loved ones around the table. She says, “Having an item that belonged to a grandmother or great-grandmother is of great value and rarity. Now, I am creating such objects for the future.”

            What would artists create if all of the world's surfaces could become a canvas? <a href='kong.html' class="hover-black" >Joseph Ford</a> —of <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" >Invisible Jumpers</a> fame—responds to this question in a new project called <em> Impossible Street Art</em>. Collaborating with eight artists including <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" >Peeta</a> ( <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > previously </a>), <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > Levalet </a> ( <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > previously </a>), and <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > Victoria  Villasana </a> ( <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > previously </a>), Ford reimagines the possibilities of public spaces that are otherwise inaccessible due to scale, safety issues, or restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin the project, Ford photographed the locations, which include the Panthéon, the Seven Sisters cliffs in Sussex, and the center of a highway in Los Angeles, and then handed over enlarged prints to the artists. Once their additions were complete, he returned to the original sites and documented the altered images against the original backdrop. Playful and imaginative, the juxtaposed photos envision “a parallel universe where (artists) have complete artistic freedom.”

            “Duality is the idea that there are two realms within (the) spirit world,” says <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" >Delita Martin </a>, “one that is seen and one that is unseen.” This coupling is a grounding force for the artist as she practices an alchemy of spirit and aesthetics, coaxing dynamic figures from a mélange of patterns, materials, and symbols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through a vivid body of work titled <em>Conjure</em>, Martin explores what it means to be self-empowered as a Black woman and embrace “the veilscape,” a spirit world in which the unseen, freedom from racism and sexism, transformation, and ancestral connection prevail. The artist refers to this space as an “intangible reality” and returns to it again and again as she overlays her relief-printed portraits with charcoal, acrylic, gold leaf, and threaded details.

            While this conceptual layer remains throughout all of Martin's works, her vast use of symbols shifts with each portrait. She might feature a bird mid-flight, as in “Flying (Feather Skirt),” for example, to convey an unrestricted spirit, or a full flock bound to a subject’s shoulders as in “Feathers” to communicate the experience of being tethered to another. Recurring in different forms on garments or backdrops, circles are similarly evocative as they reference the connection between the divine feminine and the moon. Color, too, is emblematic. She shares:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote-border-b">
            <p>
              Although I do not subscribe to any particular theory on color, I very much believe that color causes a reaction and can connect with the human spirit. For my own purposes, colors like red and orange carry a fiery energy, and blues are very calming and actually connect more closely to the spirit world in my work than any other color. I tend to favor blues the most in my work. Yellows and golds are what I consider outdoor colors that reference the earth, colors that are closely related to the waking world. Greens I connect with nature and growth. Purples/burgundy I associate with mystery and time.

            Washes of acrylic or fragments of colorful patterns blur the distinction between body and surroundings, emphasizing the co-existence of the physical and spiritual worlds and reminding the viewer that part of the self always remains invisible and hidden behind the veil.

            Photography is often touted as one of the most accessible and democratic mediums, making it a prime choice for those with little institutional support or access to funding. A new book edited by Luce Lebart and Marie Robert and published by <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > Thames & Hudson </a> explores the work of more than 300 women, many of whom were underrecognized during their lifetimes, and all of whose practices centered around the camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently translated from French by Ruth Taylor and Bethany Wright, the hefty <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" ><em>A World History of Women Photographers </em></a> is a corrective encyclopedia highlighting those with outsized impacts on the medium. The 504-page book pairs hundreds of images with text by an international roster of 160 women writers, granting similar space to each photographer and unearthing a chronically undervalued group. “With this collection of artists, it is not so much a matter of producing a counter-narrative or of deconstructing histories that already exist but of completing them. We have no desire to burn idols or topple statues, only to erect new ones, and to create a narrative that is richer and more fair,” the editors write in the introduction. “In other words, there is an urgent need to write another history, and to write it differently.”

            Included in the chronologically organized text that spans from 1850 to today are luminaries like <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > Carrie Mae Weems </a> and <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > Zanelle Muholi </a> ( <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > previously</a> ), in addition to those who have only recently come into public view. The Argentine photographer <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > Josefina Oliver </a> (b. 1875) was largely unknown until her great-niece unearthed her archives in 2006, for example, and that same year, <a href="kong.html"  class="hover-black" > Karimeh Abbud </a> (b. 1863), the first woman to establish a studio in Palestine in the early 20th century, was recognized for her distinct portraiture style in the first major exhibition of her work. “This ‘world tour’ enables us to re-evaluate some women who were celebrated and acknowledged in their own time, to remember others now unjustly forgotten, and to discover others whose work was never exhibited or discussed during their lifetime,” the editors say.
